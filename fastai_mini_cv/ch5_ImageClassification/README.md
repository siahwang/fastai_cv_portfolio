# Chapter 5: Image Classification

This folder is split into two notebooks:

1. **Part 1 – Core Workflow**  
   Covers data preparation, learning-rate finder, freeze/unfreeze, discriminative learning rates, epoch selection, and deeper architectures with mixed precision.

2. **Part 2 – Model Interpretation & Conclusion**  
   Shows how to analyze model performance (confusion matrix, most confused), diagnose overfitting, and wraps up with a deep dive into cross-entropy loss.
